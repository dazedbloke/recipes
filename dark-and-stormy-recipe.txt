2 parts dark rum
1 part ginger beer
2 dashes of orange bitters
1 tsp sugar
Mint leaves
Muddle sugar, bitters, and crushed mint leaves.
Add rum.
Stir with ice, and add ginger beer.
Serve straight with mint leaves to garnish.

Potential Variation: Add a dash of cointreau to open up a citrusy flavour. Do not add sugar in this case, muddle with a dash of cointreau.
Added flavour: Mildly char sugar before muddling to create a more interesting profile.
