2 part dark rum
1 part ginger beer
2 dashes of orange bitters
1 tsp sugar
Mint leaves
Muddle sugar, bitters, and crushed mint leaves.
Add rum.
Stir with ice, and add ginger beer.
Serve straight with mint leaves to garnish.

Potential Variation: Add a dash of cointreau to open up a citrusy tropical flavour. Sugar can be avoided in this case.
Added flavour: Mildly char sugar before muddling to create a more interesting profile.
